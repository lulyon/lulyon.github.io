                <p>Dear Dr. Cooper, </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Main">
                <p>I am a researcher at the Institute of Computing Technology, at Chinese Academy of Sciences. I have devoted nearly ten years to the study of how high performance Computing Technology can be applied to the validation of physical theory. I was intrigued by the recent accomplishments of you in research from bosonic String Theory to Heterotic String Theory. Therefore I wish to visit your lab and cooperate with your working group for a year, preferably from the year of 2021 to the year of 2022. </p>
                <p>During the last three years, I have been leading our High Performance Computing Team, accomplishing many important simulation of physical theory. Our cross-disciplinary cooperation would highly boost the development of High Performance Computing Technology of IT industry in nearby silicon valley. Also, our cooperation would help Chinese conterpart learn state-of-the-art physical theory. Again, our cooperation would lead a new direction of research in scientific community.</p>
                <p>I would greatly appreciate it if you accept me or my working group as your coworker. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any more information.</p>
